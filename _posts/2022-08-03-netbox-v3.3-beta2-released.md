The second beta release for NetBox v3.3 is [now available](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.3-beta2)! Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.3-beta2) for a list of changes from the first beta release, and everything new coming in v3.3.

As with every beta release, this is **not suitable for production use**. It is intended for evaluation and testing only. (We hope to have the final v3.3.0 release ready in a couple weeks.)

You're also welcome to try our [public demo instance](https://beta-demo.netbox.dev/), which gets rebuilt nightly from the project's `feature` branch. Let us know what you think!
