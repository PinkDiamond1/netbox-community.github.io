Are you a NetBox power user? Maybe you've even built a plugin or custom script? Would you like to be more involved in feature development and roadmap planning for NetBox? To better enable community members like you to have a direct impact on NetBox's development, today we're launching the **NetBox Advocates Program**!

What does it mean to be a NetBox advocate?

* We'll occasionally reach out (via email) for feedback on specific new or planned NetBox features. For example, we may ask for feedback on the plugins development experience, or which of several potential new features you'd prefer to see first. This feedback will help guide NetBox's long-term development.

* You may be offered access to pre-release instances of NetBox or other tools for evaluation and feedback.

* You'll be able to leverage our [community Sentry service](https://netbox.dev/tips%20and%20tricks/sentry-error-logging/) for error reporting and correlation. We'll proactively reach out to advocates who opt to enable this service regarding any new errors we detect. We may ask if you can assist with reproducing the error to help develop a fix, or point you to a potential fix.

* Your organization's logo will optionally be published in our list of advocates.

And this is just the beginning! We fully expect the importance of the advocates program to grow as the NetBox ecosystem continues to expand.
