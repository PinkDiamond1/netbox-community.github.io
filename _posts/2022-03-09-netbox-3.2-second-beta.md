The second beta release of NetBox v3.2 is [now available](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/releases/tag/v3.2-beta2)! This release fixes several bugs found in the first beta, and continues extending and refining the plugins framework. You can install it locally, or try out our public demo at [beta-demo.netbox.dev](https://beta-demo.netbox.dev/)! (If you happen to run into any problems while testing the beta release, please be sure to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues/new/choose) to let us know.)

We're making excellent progress toward the final v3.2.0 release, which is planned for the week of April 4th. Stay tuned!
