...and lots more! Check out the [beta release notes](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/feature/release-notes/version-3.3/) for a complete list of improvements.

Bear in mind that, being a beta release, this is not yet suitable for production use. However, you are more than welcome to help us test it for final release. We even have a public demo instance available at [beta-demo.netbox.dev](https://beta-demo.netbox.dev/). Your feedback during this evaluation period will help to ensure a smooth final release for version 3.3, which we expect to make available in mid-August.

Let us know what you think!
