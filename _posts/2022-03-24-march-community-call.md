The recording of our March community call is now [available on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UDRUpXrh5Y) This month's call features [Dinesh Dutt](https://www.stardustsystems.net/about/), co-founder of SuzieQ. [SuzieQ](https://www.stardustsystems.net/suzieq/) is a powerful open source tool which enables network engineers to inspect and query the live network, compare it to a designated source of truth, and alert on changes. Dinesh discusses how you can integrate SuzieQ directly with your existing NetBox deployment to get up and running in no time!
