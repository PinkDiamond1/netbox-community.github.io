We had an amazing turnout for this year's NetBox community survey, with **487 total responses**. Thank you very much to everyone who took the time to participate! The data generated will help inform our roadmap for the rest of 2022 and beyond.

A detailed analysis of the results has been [posted over on GitHub](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions/9026), so check it out if you'd like to learn more about the organizations that use NetBox and what they want to see.
