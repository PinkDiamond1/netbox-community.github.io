I'll be hosting another NetBox live coding session today at 6pm UTC / 1pm EST. These sessions run about an hour long, during which I try to knock out various feature requests and bug reports from GitHub, sharing my screen and narrating as I go. I also take relevant questions from the chat. This is a great way to get a "behind the scenes" look at NetBox development, and open source development in general.

These sessions are streamed live via YouTube; no registration is required. Please join us! You can watch today's stream at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnl8mzMax2w>, and previous recordings are available on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyTz3NglyCnIAhvEgat41sQ).
