I'm happy to announce the addition of two new NetBox maintainers: [Arthur Hanson](https://github.com/arthanson) and [Jonathan Senecal](https://github.com/jsenecal)!

Arthur recently joined NS1 as a senior software engineer to focus on the development of NetBox and related projects. A bit more about Arthur:

> Arthur has worked as a software developer and manager for many years at both startups and Fortune 500 companies. His background includes developing network drivers, protocols, and operating systems. He lives in a small town outside Seattle, Washington with his wife and son. Besides programming, he loves travel, Thai food, and discussing Marvel movies with his son.

By contrast, Jonathan joins as a NetBox power user who has graciously volunteered to help improve and maintain the open source project. From [his website](https://www.jonathansenecal.com/):

> My personal mission is to make things, fix stuff and help others. I just happened to love working with high tech stuff so it became my area of expertise.
>
> I have over 10 years of experience in telecommunications, server infrastructures and carrier-grade network design & build. Bleeding edge software technologies have become parts of my toolset to create powerful and unique infrastructures. I eat DevOps for breakfast.

Both Arthur and Jonathan have already made substantial contributions to NetBox, and we're elated to have both of them on our team. If you see them around on the [community Slack](https://netdev.chat/), be sure to say hi!
