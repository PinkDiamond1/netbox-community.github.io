This year's [Cisco Live](https://www.ciscolive.com/) conference in Las Vegas boasts a DevNet session titled "[Next-Level Automation Using Sources of Truth](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/attend/sessions/session-catalog.html?cid=2022spkrsocial&search=DEVWKS-2295#/)," which features NetBox! From the session catalog:

> You’ve taken the leap and started automating your network – but it’s time to move past writing single-use scripts that have hardcoded values in them. Are you still storing your credentials in a file or passing them via environment variables? Is the inventory of devices stored in a YAML file? If so, it’s time to embrace Sources of Truth! In this session, participants will use REST APIs to securely store and access secrets using HashiCorp Vault and then manage network device inventory using NetBox. Once the sources of truth are configured, we will use this data to configure a network topology. Move away from text files and take your automation skills to the next level!

The 45-minute session (dubbed DEVWKS-2295) will be presented by Palmer Sample and Juulia Santala, and has an "intermediate" technical level rating. Sounds like fun!
