The recording of our September community call is now [available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/wD2EsuQq4Ew)! This month, we welcome [Jonathan Senecal](https://github.com/jsenecal) to the maintainers team, celebrate the release of [terraform-provider-netbox](https://github.com/smutel/terraform-provider-netbox) version 3.0, and highlight some interesting recent discussion. Perhaps most exicting is that [Daren Fulwell](https://twitter.com/DarenFulwell) joins us to demonstrate how users can leverage [IP Fabric](https://ipfabric.io/) network assurance platform to programmatically and safely populate NetBox data.

Anyone interested in experimenting with IP Fabric can obtain a free demo license [here](https://ipfabric.io/lab-licence-page/) (good for up to 50 devices and six months). I'm very excited to see how this integration matures in the near future!
